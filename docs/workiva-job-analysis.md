## Role Recommendation

**Apply for both, but lead with VP** (posted 3 days ago = fresher):
- Your seniority likely fits VP better
- ESG/sustainability expertise is more valuable at VP level (strategic direction)
- Financial Services angle is relevant to both, but VP owns broader strategy

**If they push you toward Sr Director:**
- Still excellent fit (explicitly owns Financial Services CS)
- Could be faster path if VP has internal candidates
- Negotiate at top of range given VP-level experience

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Don't say "support"** — say "success" or "engagement"
2. **Don't be reactive** — emphasize proactive, predictive, outcomes-based
3. **Don't focus on product training** — focus on business transformation, value realization
4. **Don't undersell ESG expertise** — this is your unique angle; Workiva just spent $100M on it

## Timeline Note

- VP role posted 3 days ago — **apply within the week**
- Sr Director posted 23 days ago — still active but moving faster
- Prepare tailored materials for each (slight emphasis differences)
