## Where Viva Insights Wins

**Deep M365 integration.** If your company lives in Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint, Viva Insights can pull data from all of them. It sees not just calendar events but Teams messages, document collaboration, and more.

**Organizational-scale analytics.** Viva Insights can analyze patterns across thousands of employees. If you're an HR leader at a Fortune 500 company measuring burnout risk across business units, this is powerful.

**Built-in productivity features.** Focus mode, virtual commute, and meeting insights are baked directly into Outlook and Teams. No additional app to install.

**Already included.** If you're paying for M365 E3/E5, basic personal insights are already there. You're not adding another vendor.

## Where CalWizz Wins

**Simplicity.** CalWizz does one thing extremely well: help you understand your calendar health. No complex dashboards, no consultant required to set it up. Connect your calendar, get your score.

**Works with Google Calendar.** If your team uses Google Workspace (most startups do), Viva Insights isn't an option. CalWizz supports both Google and Outlook.

**Transparent pricing.** You can see exactly what CalWizz costs on our website. No "contact sales" for a quote, no enterprise minimums.

**Meeting cost in dollars.** Our free [Meeting Cost Calculator](https://calculator.calwizz.com) and in-app analytics show you exactly what your meetings cost in real money. This is a powerful lever for changing meeting culture — it's one thing to say "we have too many meetings," another to say "that recurring meeting costs $24,000/year."

**Built for teams, not enterprises.** Viva Insights is designed for compliance, HR reporting, and organizational analytics. CalWizz is designed for engineering managers who want to protect their team's focus time. Different tools for different jobs.

**Speed.** CalWizz takes minutes to set up. Viva Insights' advanced features require IT involvement, licensing decisions, and sometimes external consultants.
