🚀 Just shipped: The Meeting Cost Calculator

Enter 5 numbers. Get your meeting's true annual cost.

That "quick weekly sync" with 8 people?
$31,200/year.

The math will hurt. But you need to see it.

```
Your 1-hour weekly meeting with 6 people costs $15,600/year.

But that's just the meeting itself.

Add 15 minutes of prep time per person?

Now it's $19,500.

I built a calculator to expose these invisible costs. 🧵

### Day 2 - Stats/Insights

**Tweet 3**
```
The average company spends $25,000/year on Slack.

They spend $1.2 MILLION on meetings.

One of these gets scrutinized. The other doesn't.

Run the numbers → calculator.calwizz.com

```
Hot take: Your standup costs more than your annual software subscriptions.

15 min × 10 engineers × $150k avg salary × 250 days = $46,875/year

For a meeting that could be a Slack post.

### Day 3 - Engagement Hook

**Tweet 5**
```
What's the most expensive meeting you've ever been in?

I once sat in a 2-hour "brainstorm" with 15 people.

At average tech salaries, that single meeting cost $4,500.

The output? A shared doc no one read.

What's your horror story? 👇
```

### Day 4 - Tip/Tactical

**Tweet 6**
```
Before you schedule that meeting, run the numbers:

→ calculator.calwizz.com

If the cost makes you flinch, it's probably not worth it.

A $500 meeting better deliver $500+ in value.

Most don't.
```

### Day 5 - Provocative

**Tweet 7**
```
The meeting you just scheduled costs more than your monthly AWS bill.

But no one approved it. No one reviewed the ROI. No CFO signed off.

Meetings are the largest unmanaged expense at most companies.

**Tweet 8**
```
"It's just a 30-minute meeting."

30 minutes × 8 people × weekly × 52 weeks = 1,664 person-hours/year.

That's literally one full-time employee's entire year.

For ONE recurring meeting.

## Week 2: Depth & Engagement

### Day 8 - The Prep Time Angle

**Tweet 9**
```
Everyone forgets about prep time.

A "1-hour meeting" with 30 min prep each is really:
→ 1 hour meeting
→ 6 × 30 min prep = 3 hours
→ Total: 4 hours consumed

Our calculator includes this. Most people are shocked.

calculator.calwizz.com
```

**Tweet 10**
```
The prep time multiplier:

- 6-person meeting with 30 min prep each
- Meeting: $450
- Prep: $270
- Real cost: $720

60% higher than the "meeting" itself.

Stop ignoring prep time: calculator.calwizz.com

### Day 9 - Fun Comparisons

**Tweet 11**
```
Things that cost less than your weekly all-hands:

☕ 2 months of office coffee
🎧 AirPods Max for everyone
✈️ A team offsite flight
🍕 Pizza Fridays for a year

### Day 10 - Engagement Hook

**Tweet 12**
```
Reply with your company's most useless recurring meeting.

I'll calculate what it actually costs per year.

(The answers will be uncomfortable)

### Day 11 - Stats/Insight

**Tweet 13**
```
Wild stat from our calculator users:

Most people guess their weekly meeting cost at ~$2,000.

The actual average? $8,400.

4x underestimation.

Meetings are invisible costs. This makes them visible.

**Tweet 14**
```
A 10-person meeting at $150k average salary:

• 30 min = $375
• 60 min = $750
• 90 min = $1,125

Now multiply by "weekly" and "52 weeks."

That's a salary. For a meeting.

calculator.calwizz.com
```

### Day 12 - Tip/Tactical

**Tweet 15**
```
The $500 meeting rule:

Before scheduling, calculate the cost.

If it's over $500, ask yourself:
→ Does this need to be a meeting?
→ Do all these people need to attend?
→ Does it need to be this long?

If yes, proceed. If no, don't.

calculator.calwizz.com
```

### Day 13 - Provocative

**Tweet 16**
```
Your company would never spend $50k without approval.

But 10 people in a weekly 1-hour meeting for a year?

That's exactly $50k.

No approval. No budget review. No ROI analysis.

Just... scheduled.

```
"We can't afford another engineer."

Meanwhile, your 8 meetings/week with 7+ people cost $312,000/year.

That's two engineers.

### Day 14 - Shareable/Wrap Up

**Tweet 18**
```
Share this with whoever schedules the most meetings:

calculator.calwizz.com

The URL stays the same after you calculate — so you can share your actual meeting costs.

Sometimes a link says more than an email.

**For whenever someone complains about meetings:**
```
Next time, send them this: calculator.calwizz.com

Nothing kills a bad meeting faster than showing what it actually costs.
```

**For engagement on meeting culture threads:**
```
The problem is meetings are invisible costs.

No one would approve a $30k annual expense without review.

But that's exactly what a weekly 1-hour meeting with 8 people costs.
