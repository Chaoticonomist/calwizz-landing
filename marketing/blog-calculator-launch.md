# We Built a Meeting Cost Calculator. The Results Will Make You Uncomfortable.

**TL;DR:** That "quick weekly sync" is probably costing you $15,000/year. We built a free calculator to prove it. [Try it →](https://calculator.calwizz.com)

## Meetings Are the Largest Unmanaged Expense at Most Companies

Your company would never spend $50,000 without approval. There would be a budget review, an ROI analysis, sign-offs from three different people.

But schedule a weekly 1-hour meeting with 10 people?

That's exactly $50,000/year. No approval required. No one tracks it. No one questions it.

This is the paradox of meeting culture: **meetings are one of the largest expenses at most companies, but they're completely invisible.**

We buy $200/month SaaS tools and debate whether they're worth it. Meanwhile, we burn $8,000/month on meetings that could be emails — and no one blinks.

We built the [Meeting Cost Calculator](https://calculator.calwizz.com) to change that.

## How the Calculator Works

It's simple. Enter five numbers:

1. **Number of attendees** — How many people are in this meeting?
2. **Average salary** — What do these people make? (We use $150k as a default for tech, but adjust to your reality)
3. **Meeting duration** — 30 minutes? An hour? That epic 2-hour planning session?
4. **Frequency** — Weekly? Daily? Monthly?
5. **Prep time per person** — This is the killer most people forget

Hit calculate. Watch your assumptions crumble.

The calculator shows you the **annual cost** of that meeting — both in raw dollars and in fun comparisons to help you contextualize the damage.

The URL updates as you enter numbers, so you can share it directly. Sometimes a link says more than an email ever could.

## Let's Run Some Numbers

### The Weekly Standup

Everyone loves standups. Agile says so. But let's do the math:

- 10 engineers
- $150k average salary (~$75/hour)
- 15 minutes daily
- 5 days a week
- No prep time

**Annual cost: $46,875**

For a meeting that could be a Slack post in #standup. 

But wait — if your standup is actually 25 minutes (be honest, it drifts), that jumps to **$78,125/year.**

That's a junior developer's salary. For *one* recurring meeting.

### The Weekly All-Hands

- 50 people
- $120k average salary
- 1 hour weekly
- 15 minutes prep (reading the agenda, context-switching)

**Annual cost: $225,000/year**

That's... a lot of pizza Fridays you could fund instead.

### "Quick 30-Minute Sync"

Your calendar is full of these. Let's say:

- 6 people
- $140k average
- 30 minutes
- Weekly
- 10 minutes prep

**Annual cost: $13,650**

That's not a "quick sync." That's a line item.

## The Prep Time Multiplier (Most People Miss This)

Here's what makes our calculator different: **we include prep time.**

Everyone calculates meeting cost as `attendees × hourly rate × duration`. That's wrong. It ignores:

- Time spent reviewing the agenda
- Time spent context-switching into the meeting
- Time spent getting back to deep work after
- Time spent preparing presentations or updates

A "1-hour meeting" with 6 people who each spend 30 minutes prepping isn't 6 person-hours. It's 9 person-hours.

**That's a 50% underestimation.**

When you add prep time to your calculations, the numbers get uncomfortable fast. Which is exactly the point.

## What You Can Do With This

### 1. Think Before You Schedule

Run the numbers before you create that calendar invite. If a 30-minute sync costs $600, ask yourself: is this meeting going to generate $600 in value?

If the answer is "probably not," don't schedule it.

### 2. Audit Your Recurring Meetings

List every recurring meeting you own. Run each one through the calculator. 

We guarantee at least one will make you physically wince. Cancel that one.

### 3. Share Strategically

The calculator generates shareable URLs. If someone keeps scheduling expensive, low-value meetings, send them the link.

It's less confrontational than saying "your meetings are a waste of time" — but the math speaks for itself.

### 4. Make the Invisible Visible

The reason meeting culture is broken is because the costs are hidden. They don't show up on any P&L. No one budgets for them.

This calculator makes the cost visible. And visibility is the first step toward change.

## Why We Built This

At CalWizz, we're building calendar analytics tools to help teams understand how they spend their time. The Meeting Cost Calculator is a free, standalone tool that embodies our core belief:

**You can't fix what you can't measure.**

Every team knows meetings are a problem. But "too many meetings" isn't actionable. "$312,000/year in meetings that could be async" is.
